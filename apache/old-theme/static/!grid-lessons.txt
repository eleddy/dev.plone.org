Rules of thumb:
- All cells need the following CSS classes:
  - Cell 
  - Width 
  - Position

- Never combine the layout divs with other class definitions, it can end up being very messy. Keep them separate, and put the real elements inside. This ensures that padding/margins can't mess up your layouts.

- You can put things in the best order since the positioning is independent of order (within a row, that is)

- Don't go overboard with using the grid, sometimes it's easier to do simple floats.

- Once you start doing grid layouts, you will notice how important it is to put margins on the right and bottom parts of elements.
